278!#@!#@A 17-year-old Mpumalanga girl who poured acid on her boyfriend's genitals to punish him for distributing a pornographic video he made of her without her knowledge, has blamed anger for her actions.||Girl destroys boyfriends penis in acid attack after video of them having sex goes viral Girl destroys boyfriends penis in acid attack after video of them having sex goes viral||"I never intended to kill his penis. I was just angry and all I wanted was to make him feel the pain I was feeling," she told a Sapa correspondent.||"I heard about the video from one of my classmates and I thought that they were joking, but then I saw the video myself and lost my mind."||The girl, whose name is known to a Sapa correspondent but cannot be published because she is a minor, attacked Humphrey Khoza, 25, with battery acid while he was drinking beer with friends at a tavern in Cork village, near Hazyview, on January 17.||She said Khoza had tricked her because she was not aware he was not using a condom or that he was filming them.||"I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl," she said.||She searched in her father's tools for a wheel spanner she could use to teach Khoza a lesson.||"While I was searching I came across an old acid bottle. I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I didn't hesitate to pour the acid on him," she said.||Khoza, who had no problem with his name being published, but asked not to be photographed, said he had been dating the girl since December.||"Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle, but I didn't realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog," he said.||"She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex."||In the video, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, in her school uniform, onto a bed. He added that the sex was consensual.||"We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still don't know how it got onto social media," he said.||The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.||He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but does not see the point.||"Even if I press charges it is useless because it won't bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts," said Khoza.||He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery.||The girl said she was also considering pressing charges relating to his creation of pornography.||According to the Film and Publications Act, child pornography is defined as "any image or any description of a person, real or simulated, who is, or who is depicted or described as being, under the age of 18 years, engaged in sexual conduct".||When asked for comment Calcutta police said they would open a case if either of the two came forward.
507!#@!#@HELL hath no fury like a woman scorned.||A jealous wife in China chopped off her cheating husband’s penis as he slept, then snuck into his hospital room after he had it sewn back on — and hacked it off again and tossed it out the window.||Fan Lung, a dad of five, sealed his fate when he decided to use his wife’s cellphone to send his secret lover a hot and heavy email, Central European News reports.||The 32-year-old forgot to log out of his account after the message was sent, which is how his 21-year-old wife, Feng — who is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm — came across the saucy exchange and snapped.||The jilted wife went berserk, grabbed a pair of scissors, stormed into their bedroom and cut off his penis while he was sleeping.||Lung was rushed to the hospital, where doctors were able to save the appendage and sew it back on.||But Feng was able to sneak into the recovery room, where she chopped his penis off a second time and threw it out the window, according to CEN.||A shocked Lung chased his wife outside, despite losing a lot of blood.||“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,” a hospital spokesman said. “He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”||Despite desperate search efforts, authorities were unable to find Lung’s manhood. Police believe it may have been stumbled upon by a stray dog or cat, according to CEN.||The woman Lung was cheating with — Zhang Hung, 21 — said she’s OK with her man not being able to have more children.||“It doesn’t matter that he’s lost his fertility,” she told CEN. “He has five children already.”
1257!#@!#@A woman in China is facing jail time for slicing off her 3-year-old nephew’s penis in anger.||Xue Paan was babysitting her nephew, 3-year-old Qiang Qiang, while Qiang’s mother – Paan’s sister – went to visit neighbors nearby.||Reports indicate that Paan was sitting on the toilet texting her boyfriend when the toddler burst into the bathroom and asked if he could play games on her smart phone.||The toddler’s question reportedly sent Paan into such a rage that she went to the kitchen, grabbed a blunt knife, and completely severed the screaming child’s penis.||The 37-year-old woman then allegedly fled the scene. Qiang’s mother heard his screams and rushed back the apartment.||“I had popped out to see a neighbor and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream,” Qiang’s mother said.||Inquisitr reports that the child had apparently fainted and was lying in a pool of his own blood when his mother arrived; a knife was next to his severed penis.||Qiang’s mother recalls that she “couldn’t believe what I saw.”||The young boy was rushed to the hospital, where surgeons managed to reattach his penis. He was then sent to a specialist in Beijing.||A hospital spokesperson told reporters that, although the boy’s penis was reattached, “it wasn’t ideal and he had to have further treatment. However, he has now had three surgeries, all of which have been successful, and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.”||Paan was arrested. She admitted to attacking the boy because she was angry that “he had interrupted her on the toilet.”||She now faces up to five years in jail for the attack.
64!#@!#@No, you do not need to adjust your sets, you are actually looking at a woman with three breasts.||Jasmine Tridevil wants to work on TV and in a bid to get there she has spent $20,000 on surgery to get an extra boob.||It was a bit of an uphill struggle for Jasmine, however, as she says she asked between 50 and 60 doctors but none of them wanted to do it because they would be breaking ethics codes.||It took two years to save up for the surgery but it has now been finished, topped off with a tattooed nipple.||She told Real Radio 104.1: My whole dream is to get this show on MTV.||Scroll down for video||Her mother and sister are no longer talking to her (Picture: Facebook/Jasmine Tridevil)||‘I’m dumping every penny I have into this.

Because I don’t want to date anymore.’||However, her mum and sister will not speak to her and her father is ashamed of her.
1287!#@!#@Notorious murderer Charles Manson, 80, is probably relieved that his jailhouse marriage license expired last week. According to the author of an upcoming book, the inmate’s fiancé, Afton Elaine “Star” Burton, 26, only wanted to marry him so that she could display his dead corpse as a tourist attraction after his death.||Journalist Daniel Simone, author of the upcoming The Retrial of Charles Manson, told the New York Post that Burton wanted access to Manson’s corpse so that she could display it in public in a glass enclosure after his death, in a kind of “bizarre California version of Lenin’s tomb.”||“He finally realized that he’s been played for a fool,” Simone told the Post of Manson, who was set to marry Burton after the pair secured a marriage license last year. The wedding had to be scrapped after the 90-day marriage license expired before the couple could tie the knot.||However, Simone tells the paper that Manson had another, perfectly sensible reason for turning Burton down.||“He feels he will never die,” Simone said. “Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.”||According to the Associated Press, Burton left her home in Illinois and moved to Central California to be near California State Prison, Corcoran, where Manson is incarcerated.||Manson and several of his “family” members were convicted in 1971 for the brutal murders of seven people, including Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, and married couple Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.||Manson was at first sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole when California tossed out the death penalty in 1972.||Manson was denied parole for the twelfth time in April 2012. He will next be eligible in 2027, when he will be 92 years old.
325!#@!#@Yes, that's right. Last week, Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner "adopted" a boy as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf, according to multiple news reports. She tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of Yair Tawil, the seventh child of an Argentine Jewish family, during which the Tawils met with the president and lit candles on a menorah.||Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera||— Cristina Kirchner (@CFKArgentina) December 23, 2014||A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as "el lobison" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form, feeding on the dead and murdering all before it. The legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.||In the past half-century, the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now, for the first time, Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to non-Catholic families. The boy's new status as the president's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship, according to the Independent.||Tales of shape-shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of Tau, an evil mythological spirit, and Kerana, a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was "Luison," who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and eats corpses.||Some historians dispute the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson, and suggest the latter is a distinct custom brought over by Eastern European migrants.||Americans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentina's head of state. After all, the U.S. president participates in the ritual pardoning of a fluffy and presumably bewildered animal every year.
2560!#@!#@At this point, it almost feels like the Washington Post is trolling everyone with the amount of fake news they put out.||During the meeting wherein the Washington Post asserted that Jared Kushner proposed a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, it was actually the Russians who proposed it, a source close to Kushner informed Fox News.||The source alleges that the permanent back channel “was never discussed”. What really happened was the proposal of a one-off call about Syria.||Fox News reports:||A December meeting between Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and one of the senior advisers in the Trump administration, and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at Trump Tower focused on Syria, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Monday.||During the meeting the Russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, not Kushner, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. That follows a recent report from The Washington Post alleging that Kushner wanted to develop a secure, private line with Russia.||The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation.||In addition, the source told Fox News the December meeting focused on Russia’s contention the Obama administration’s policy on Syria was deeply flawed.||. . .||Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.||The fake news from the Washington Post just keeps coming and yet they are never to be held accountable for some reason.||You can watch a Fox News video below wherein they discuss the fake news the Washington Post pushed:

After the men shout out sleazy comments, the women pull off their wigs and confront their red-faced boys with a very loud and very public rebuke.||One enraged mother is seen hitting her son over the head with her handbag.||The clip, created by American clothing brand Everlast, was filmed in Peru’s national capital Lima, where the company says 7 out of 10 women report being harassed in the street.
2500!#@!#@(CNN) -- Joan Rivers' personal throat doctor denies "performing an unauthorized procedure" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN.||Dr. Gwen Korovin also "categorically denies" taking a selfie photo while Rivers was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the same source said Thursday.||The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN -- that staff members at the clinic told investigators Korovin snapped the selfie and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers.||Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic.||CNN's source close to the investigaton also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie.||Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers "will think this is funny" or "would love this" as she took the photo, the source said.||Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.||The source also provided more specific information about what procedures were done on Rivers.||Several clinic workers told investigators that it began with Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds.||Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning in the wake of Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore and hoarse throat, the source said.||Cohen detected something of concern, the source said..||Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cut off of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source.||Rivers was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.||Korovin was only authorized to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said.||Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated.||Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.||The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autograph photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews.||"I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music," Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year.||Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the reports:||"Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.||"As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.||"For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients."||The clinic is still open, although an accreditation group is calling for it to suspend procedures and surgeries, according to letters obtained by CNN. Patients were seen in the clinic's waiting room Wednesday.||The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF) sent representatives for an unscheduled visit to the clinic after hearing about Rivers' cardiac arrest, according to letters from the group.||The letters cited two "deficiencies" found by the representatives, declared the clinic to be in "immediate jeopardy" and placed it on "emergency suspension." The accreditation group said the clinic should stop procedures and surgeries "until accreditation questions are settled."||The clinic sent CNN a statement Wednesday night in response to questions about the accreditation association's letter putting the facility under "emergency suspension."||"Yorkville Endoscopy continues to maintain its federal, state and Quad A (AAAASF) authorization to be operational and provide patient care. Yorkville Endoscopy is committed to adhering to the standards established by Quad A (AAASF)," the statement said.||While the accreditation agency has no power to shut a clinic down, the state of New York does. State health investigators also found deficiencies in Rivers' treatment, according to a source close to the death investigation. These include the participation of River's personal throat doctor.||Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death||Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.||The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Cohen "is not currently performing procedures. ... Nor is he currently serving as medical director."||The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.||The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.||As my son Cooper and I mourn the loss of my mother, we want to thank everyone for the beautiful cards and flowers co... http://t.co/FKPejY4nQz||Melissa Rivers has been silent since her mother's death on September 4, although she did post an online message thanking friends and fans Wednesday evening.||"As my son Cooper and I mourn the loss of my mother, we want to thank everyone for the beautiful cards and flowers conveying heartfelt messages and condolences, which continue to arrive from around the world and through social media.
